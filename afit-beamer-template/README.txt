Instructions for using the afit-beamer-template theme.

1.  Copy the `afit-beamer-template` directory (Ctrl-C), then paste it into the
    directory containing your beamer presentation.

2.  Insert the following line into your beamer document.

\usepackage{afit-beamer-template/afit-beamer-template}

3.  Profit! ;)

To give a minimal working example (MWE), your beamer latex file might look
something like the `MWE.tex` file in this directory.
